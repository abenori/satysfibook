      In \ref-chapter(`getting-started`);, I explained the usages of basic command of \SATySFi; using \pkg{stdjareport}.
      By the way, one of big advantages of markup languages is, by defining commands by yourself, you can do many things automatically or you can define a new descriptive markup.
      In fact, commands such as \codem{+chapter}, \codem{+p} and \codem{\\dfn} are simply provided by \pkg{stdjareport}.
      Users can define a similar definitions if they want.
      I think that now many readers can't wait to define commands by themselves.
      In this chapter, I will explain a basic way to define commands.
      To say in advance, the explanations here is very ad-hoc.
      If you read this chapter after learning \SATySFi; well, you may be surprised by such explanations like a children trick.
      I thought, as I took care of various backgrounds of readers, such a rough explanation probably worth as a first step.
      So please forgive me.
      To get deeper understanding and define more flexible commands with more various functions, you need to first get a big picture of typesetting procedure done by \SATySFi;.
      After that please read \ref-chapter(`advanced-command-definition`);.
